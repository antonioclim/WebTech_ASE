/**
 * Teaching guide
 *
 * Goal: ES modules expose explicit contracts, and all importers of one resolved module share its evaluated instance.
 *
 * Why this design: Three tiny modules show imports, exports, encapsulated state, and defensive projection without requiring a browser framework.
 *
 * Follow the evidence:
 * - `summary.js` imports behavior rather than reaching into private state.
 * - Changes made through `addTask` are visible through the same module instance.
 * - Returned arrays and records are projections, so callers cannot mutate module state accidentally.
