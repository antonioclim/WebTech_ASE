/**
 * Teaching guide
 *
 * Goal: An Express request traverses middleware and one matching route before response completion, while static resources and API resources can share the same application.
 *
 * Why this design: One HTML file, one API route, and one observer make mounting order visible without introducing CRUD or validation.
 *
 * Follow the evidence:
 * - The observer runs before both static and API handlers.
 * - Only the `/api/ping` route creates the JSON response.
 * - The `finish` event occurs after the route has produced its response.
 * - `/` and `/api/ping` are different resources served by one app.
